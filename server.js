/* The `app.use()` method (used in conjunction with the `app.post` function method) is a method executed by our Express.js server that mounts a function to the server that our requests will pass through before getting to the intended endpoint. The functions we can mount to our server are referred to as middleware. --- Middleware functions can serve many different purposes. Ultimately they allow us to keep our route endpoint callback functions more readable while letting us reuse functionality across routes to keep our code DRY. --- Both The `express.urlencoded({extended: true})` method and The `express.json()` method middleware functions need to be set up every time you create a server that's looking to accept POST data.     */

// ***parse incoming string or array data*** //
// The `express.urlencoded({extended: true})` method is a method built into Express.js. It takes incoming POST data and converts it to key/value pairings that can be accessed in the req.body object. The extended: true option set inside the method call informs our server that there may be sub-array data nested in it as well, so it needs to look as deep into the POST data as possible to parse all of the data correctly.
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

// ***parse incoming JSON data*** //
// The `express.json()` method we used takes incoming POST data in the form of JSON and parses it into the req.body JavaScript object.

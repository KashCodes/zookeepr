/*    the get() method requires two arguments. The first is a string that describes the route the client will have to fetch from. The second is a callback function that will execute every time that route is accessed with a GET request. --- we can use the send() method from the res parameter (short for response) to send the strings for example, to our client. ---  To send JSON, just change send to json. We do this to change the headers (i.e., additional metadata that's sent with every request/response) so that the client knows it's receiving JSON. -- function called filterByQuery() is going to help us handle different kinds of queries.  */

/* Now that we have multiple routes, we have to pay extra attention to the order of the routes. A param route must come after the other GET route. There's a function called findById() in the callback that looks just like filterByQuery(), except this time we're passing req.params.id. We don't use filterByQuery() instease bc, we know for certain that this route should only return a single animal, because the id is unique.--- req.query is multifaceted, often combining multiple parameters, whereas req.param is specific to a single property, often intended to retrieve a single record. */

// The req object gives us access to another property for this case, `req.params`. Unlike the query object, the param object needs to be defined in the route path, with `<route>/:<parameterName>`.

/* Notice that this is just another method of the `app` object that allows us to create routes, much like `app.get()`. This method doesn't say `get` thoughâ€”it says `post`, which means that we defined a route that listens for POST requests, not GET requests. POST requests differ from GET requests in that they represent the action of a client requesting the server to accept data rather than vice versa. --- notice the route name, `/api/animals` is the same as the GET requests. It'll know which route to use because of how we form the request.    */
